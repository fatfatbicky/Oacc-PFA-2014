# Oacc-PFA-2014
A Microsoft Access based Database for Personal Finance 

Download the access file and open, no password needed.

Once opened, a form with financial status will pop-up automatically.
The buttons in the bottom section are for your daily operations and reports, and those button in the right section are for settings.

Those sample data were in the period of Oct 2014, therefore, you should select around this period to see what those reports can do.

These reports including TB, Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cashflow Statement and other Quick Review Reports

The design of this DB is based on the daily life of Hongkongers, which meant there was no mechanism of VAT, Goods & Sales Tax etc in the DB

Hope you enjoy this simple Personal Financial DB
